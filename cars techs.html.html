<h1><u>CARS TECHs</u></h1>
<h3>A car or automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport 
people instead of goods.[1][2]</h3>

<h3>The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.[3][4][5] Cars became widely available during the 20th century.
 One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced 
animal-drawn carriages and carts.[citation needed] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[6] The car is considered an 
essential part of the developed economy.</h3>
